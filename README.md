This application is based on [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/), a

## Documentation

This is a command line tool for converting a wordpress backup xml file into a
 bunch of markdown files for posts and pages (and other types).

## Installation

You have two options. Install it globally into your system and make sure the
 binary `wordpress-to-markdown` is within your `$PATH` variable.
 
The other way is to install it as your project dependency (like phpunit for
 example). Then you can run `vendor/bin/wordpress-to-markdown` within your
 project.

## Usage

Give your wordpress source xml file and the target folder the converter shall
 store the converted files.

```bash
$> wordpress-to-markdown convert path/to/your/wordpress.xml path/to/store/markdown/
```

You can force the writing process with the flag `--force`.

ThatÂ´s it.
